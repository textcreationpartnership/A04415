            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Ame (as I Å¿uppoÅ¿e) hath Å¿uffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently declared how all the <hi>IeÅ¿uits</hi> were Å¿ent and bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hed out of the Kingdomes of <hi>Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Hungaria,</hi> that they might neuer at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to come againe into thoÅ¿e Kingdomes hereafter: and this baniÅ¿hment of theirs was after this maner, that if any of thoÅ¿e <hi>IeÅ¿uits</hi> be found in the two fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿aid Kingdomes, whereÅ¿oeuer, with whom Å¿oeuer, of what condition Å¿oeuer he be; and vnder what pretence Å¿oeuer; according to the definition of the Statutes of either Kingdome, he Å¿hould pay the iuÅ¿t reward of his fact. The poore wretches are exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that neither interceÅ¿Å¿ion, nor any way deuiÅ¿ed by art or friend Å¿hould preuaile to bring them in againe for euer. Now I come to their going out, why doe they goe? Being once conÅ¿trained to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part; they went away willingly, <hi>bona voluntas non eÅ¿t agitanda calcaribus,</hi> a willing mind needs not the Å¿pur. ConÅ¿trained Å¿ay you? namely, they would
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:22038:3"/> depart for the time of anger willingly. This ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿hment and caÅ¿ting forth of them, although it brought exceeding much greefe and Å¿orrow to their whole Society, euen as that Å¿ame Bore Å¿ent by <hi>Diana</hi> into the corne of <hi>Callidonia:</hi> yet did it not altogether caÅ¿t away the Å¿peare, but rather fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed that Å¿ame moÅ¿t Godly Å¿entence, <hi>(when they Å¿hall perÅ¿ecute you in that City, fly into another.)</hi> But who doe you aske? this was their recreation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by theÅ¿e wretched Å¿tudents diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿Å¿ions of their Å¿tudies.</p>
            <p>They doe too too much earneÅ¿tly thinke that they are to Å¿earch into theÅ¿e cares, where they may recouer a Å¿ecure, and (as I may Å¿ay) a healthfull place; Å¿uch as they had left at <hi>Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garia:</hi> and Å¿ee, the euent was contrary to their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿es.</p>
            <p>While they went thither in this <hi>Bohemian. Hungarian</hi> baniÅ¿hment, that at length they might embrace faire <hi>Germanie,</hi> they come, they Å¿ee, they Å¿alute their fellowes and bretheren. O <hi>Germanie,</hi> how great a wonder wert thou to theÅ¿e baniÅ¿hed men at there firÅ¿t entrance, how diddeÅ¿t thou yeeld an allurement to thoÅ¿e greedy eies! they Å¿ee the goodneÅ¿Å¿e of the land: it is moÅ¿t wonderfull and remote from all danger: they Å¿ee the temper of the aire; it is moÅ¿t wholeÅ¿ome. There is all Å¿ound and perpetuall healthfulneÅ¿Å¿e.</p>
            <p>What Å¿hould I Å¿peake of the floriÅ¿hing fields, the high hills, and the vnhurtfull chaÅ¿es? I will not
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:22038:3" rendition="simple:additions"/> Å¿peake of the little brookes Å¿liding with a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ant brinke, and the Å¿tately kinds of woods and groues. TheÅ¿e, theÅ¿e Å¿eemed to the Fathers the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿uites</hi> moÅ¿t full of a pleaÅ¿ant Å¿weetneÅ¿Å¿e: the very midnight, which is wont to bee pleaÅ¿ant to all, they made vnquiet to themÅ¿elues. And what would it bee (Å¿ay they) if Å¿o pretious fleeces of Å¿heepe, Å¿o many fertill Cities, villages and mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿teries; and Å¿o good great a plenty of corne, oliues, and vine-yards Å¿hould appertaine vnto vs? Oh brethren, let vs make tryall, let vs vÅ¿e our beÅ¿t cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: that wee may be receiued firÅ¿t in <hi>Germanie:</hi> afterwards that wee may become Lords of it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Ã´ <hi>Germany,</hi> how thou Å¿trikeÅ¿t without a bruiÅ¿e, how thou woundeÅ¿t without blood! how quickly and louingly thou doeÅ¿t drinke to theÅ¿e Fathers the cups of their deÅ¿ire and wiÅ¿h! how thou Å¿mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿t on them! O brethren, theÅ¿e men about to touch the matter to the quicke, doe put on them (as they are wont,) the prepuce of impudency; they Å¿olicite faire <hi>Germany</hi> with earneÅ¿t and daily intreaty; that it would afford them a moÅ¿t Å¿afe defence againÅ¿t theÅ¿e clouds of baniÅ¿hment.</p>
            <p>They cry out, thou Ã´ <hi>Germany</hi> art the onely an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, which art able to preÅ¿erue this company, to chaÅ¿e away Å¿tormes amongÅ¿t the waues and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peÅ¿ts. <hi>India</hi> would moÅ¿t bountifully defend vs; neither would <hi>Italy</hi> deny vs any thing: but it is an exceeding long iourny thither; here the aire is moÅ¿t dangerous, that which way Å¿oeuer we turne
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:22038:4"/> vs, an exceeding great burthen of this difficulty is laid vpon vs.</p>
            <p>We haue no Å¿mall cauÅ¿e to reÅ¿ide elÅ¿ewhere: but now Å¿eeing our paÅ¿Å¿ing ouer hath a little taÅ¿ted of this land (in which theÅ¿e that are addicted to our fellowÅ¿hip doe not liue in want) we conclude, that this thing is not done without the diuine proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. AlÅ¿o this <hi>Germany</hi> being better knowne through a proceÅ¿Å¿e of time, hath deÅ¿erued to be a longer time loued of vs; and is accounted worthy to be adorned with the garland of our piety, and moÅ¿t faithfull inÅ¿tructing. Walke ouer and ouer it. O <hi>Germany,</hi> what is it, that our Å¿o many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies doe watch in thy townes and houÅ¿es for thy Å¿afety? other lands being let goe, wee deÅ¿ire thy helping hand, Ã´ <hi>Germany</hi> (Å¿ay they.) Let the holy Scripture moue thee; <hi>Succour the needy:</hi> Let it mooue thee, that thou maiÅ¿t follow mercy; <hi>excer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciÅ¿e mercy.</hi> Neither doe we requeÅ¿t any great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, nor things too high, onely Å¿ome monaÅ¿teries in which we may haue meate, drinke, and apparrell. In theÅ¿e monaÅ¿teries we will liue religiouÅ¿ly; we will Å¿hew our deuotion and loue towards <hi>Germany;</hi> and alÅ¿o our eÅ¿peciall care in inÅ¿tructing youth. And we, and others with vs Å¿hall fly with theÅ¿e winges, and Å¿hall exceed all humane matters. In the meane time although our innocency Å¿hall bring vs into a narrower roome and fame, yet Å¿hall it fly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine through all the coaÅ¿ts of <hi>Germany;</hi> and Å¿taine <hi>Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Hungary,</hi> vnleÅ¿Å¿e they become better.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:22038:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>Of which their wonderfull faire perÅ¿waÅ¿ion after that the brethren had made an end; the Lords the Delegates of <hi>Garmany</hi> not long meditating, at laÅ¿t doe anÅ¿wer thus. Neither doe they diÅ¿Å¿emble that they alÅ¿o are Å¿tirred and heated with that Å¿ame vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely heat. We haue beene very attentiue to your requeÅ¿t (o Fathers): AlÅ¿o we haue attentiuely heard (as is fitting) your cauÅ¿es and reaÅ¿ons, prouoking vs to prouide you Å¿ettled places amongÅ¿t vs, which truely haue beene acceptable to vs. Wee would that our anÅ¿were to you be plaine and without co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. For that you extoll our beautifull Country, <hi>Germany,</hi> with all kind of prayÅ¿es, we doe take it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably: onely this wee diÅ¿like, that you deÅ¿ire to reÅ¿t with vs in this boÅ¿ome which is proper and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to ours. And truely we do very much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that you do not Å¿eeke out and deÅ¿ire other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces fuller of our miracles. For although the ayre might be moÅ¿t dangerous in <hi>Italy,</hi> by your Å¿aying, perhaps it might bee more temperate in <hi>Spaine,</hi> where there be more of your companies; and more of your brethren. Yea there you haue your <hi>Meca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> himÅ¿elfe, who as a <hi>Minerua</hi> doth preÅ¿erue you on water, and as an <hi>VliÅ¿Å¿es</hi> doth defend you being in danger of life.</p>
            <p>Doe you Å¿ay that the iourney into <hi>India</hi> is too long? It is Å¿horter into <hi>France,</hi> where (if your apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy may bee beleeued) your companions are of late preferred with new priuiledges. If you haue there Å¿o good opportunities, why doe you Å¿triue to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:22038:5"/> forgoe them? Doe you Å¿ay it will be good for vs, hurtfull to you, to profit vs by your piety and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in our Å¿tudies? It is not expedient for you (Ã´ Fathers) if yee determine any thing to bee done of you in our right. And if we be not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, <hi>Germany</hi> hath more certaine aÅ¿Å¿ertions of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to thinke well, then <hi>TrecenÅ¿is</hi> heretofore in <hi>France</hi> (which is commonly called <hi>Troy.</hi>)</p>
            <p>But we doe exceedingly maruell what the cauÅ¿e Å¿hould be, why in Å¿o Å¿hort a time ye Å¿hould bee caÅ¿t out of Å¿o many Å¿tately common-wealths and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes? Truely all their fields are large bookes, which we cannot thruÅ¿t vpon you by turning them, but for conference Å¿ake onely Å¿hew them as true to the whole world, and of you as yet not refuted We deÅ¿ire that Å¿ome of you would behold your acts done in <hi>England: Certainly the acts of</hi> Garnet <hi>and of all of you would breath out Å¿ome other thing then Innocency:</hi> namely, treaÅ¿on, and innouation, of which you were all guilty.</p>
            <p>This one thing you obiect, (Ã´ Fathers) but know this, a deepe wound retaines a Å¿carce: Yee did not bid farewell to the <hi>Venetians</hi> againÅ¿t your wills; but perhaps vnconÅ¿trained.</p>
            <p>You had neuer gone away by the decree of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Lords, had not the commandement of <hi>Paul</hi> the fifth Pope cauÅ¿ed you, to whom being the head of the Church, you yeelded all humble obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience with due obÅ¿eruance: and in this intermiÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from Religion you adored his Surplice: <hi>So obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:22038:5" rendition="simple:additions"/> alone is the vertue which worketh the other vertues in the minde: and what were it of ye Å¿hould call him Lord, Lord, and would not doe what he Å¿aith?</hi> Ah how impatient were the <hi>Venetian</hi> Lords of your departure? How willingly would they haue detai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned you longer, if good words, honours, if more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer new priuiledges could haue preuailed any thing.</p>
            <p>But in Å¿ayling we muÅ¿t giue eare to our Pilot, in warre to our Captaine: <hi>So that fidelity due to the Pope by the Venetian title hath made you wretched men baniÅ¿hed.</hi> It is written: <hi>He that beleeueth Å¿hall be Å¿aued.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We now talke alone (Ã´ Fathers IeÅ¿uits) and are weakned: we could wiÅ¿h that a <hi>Venetian</hi> were here who might affirme theÅ¿e things.</p>
            <p>We do adde nothing heere but what your Å¿elues had in your Apology: that the will of God may be done, who is the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords; from whom as you expect Å¿aluation, Å¿o al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿o expect iuÅ¿t iudgement. We do willingly paÅ¿Å¿e ouer with Å¿ilence the <hi>Belgicke</hi> fame, declaring what reproachfull things, contentions and wicked deeds you haue there committed: If in others there bee any diÅ¿grace and wickedneÅ¿Å¿e, in you it is prayÅ¿e and comelineÅ¿Å¿e (as it is in your Apology.)</p>
            <p>We know not what to Å¿ay, onely this wee hold, that God liueth, who cauÅ¿eth his Sunne to Å¿hine vpon the good and bad, and raineth vpon the iuÅ¿t and vniuÅ¿t, and will reward euery one according to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:22038:6"/> his workes: VVe do alÅ¿o willingly paÅ¿Å¿e ouer, why wee Å¿aw your honeÅ¿t company baniÅ¿hed out of <hi>France</hi> for their faults: wee are full of writings to this purpoÅ¿e.</p>
            <p>In briefe, ye are accuÅ¿ed of treaÅ¿on and Å¿laughter intended againÅ¿t Kings: whoÅ¿e life and blood how you laid in waite for, would haue beene manifeÅ¿t (more cleare then the noon day) had not that Å¿ame <hi>Carmelitane</hi> worke couered it vpon your Martyrs. Hereupon a Catholike within theÅ¿e three yeares (if I be not deceiued) obiected fairly vnto you that you teach and write commonly, that any man of what condition Å¿oeuer hee bee, may and ought to kill or Å¿lay a King (Å¿uppoÅ¿e any King you will) for a certaine Å¿tipend or penÅ¿ion of mony, if hee bee a Tyrant, or diÅ¿obedient to your will and Å¿ayings.</p>
            <p>This is your practiÅ¿e whereby you preuaile much with bad men: whereupon you deÅ¿eruedly worÅ¿hip <hi>Henry Garnet,</hi> as a Martyr for that his wicked and Å¿auage deed, who for it was executed in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
            <p>VVee ingeniouÅ¿ly confeÅ¿Å¿e that which is proper to all <hi>Garmans,</hi> that our Gallowes, Iibbets, priÅ¿ons and all inÅ¿truments of torture, are full of Å¿uch Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs.</p>
            <p>Let vs not cheriÅ¿h a thought of the feyned and lying miracles of Å¿uch moÅ¿t falÅ¿e martyrs. We do euen tremble (as God Å¿hall help vs) that the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique religion Å¿hould couer Å¿uch Barbarous, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage, and moÅ¿t diuelliÅ¿h facts; and that it can call
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:22038:6" rendition="simple:additions"/> and worÅ¿hip Å¿uch wicked and filthy men as Saints. So much euill was religion able to perÅ¿wade. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were the winds the cauÅ¿e of their expulÅ¿ion out of thoÅ¿e moÅ¿t famous Cities of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> (we will not Å¿peake of <hi>Polonia,</hi> and <hi>Swetia:</hi>) TheÅ¿e things Å¿hall neuer be forgotten, Å¿o long as that winged charriot of Fame Å¿hall paÅ¿Å¿e through countries and ages. Yea haue beene Å¿hunners of peace and concord: yea haue brought in diÅ¿Å¿enÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, braules, and treacheries into theÅ¿e kingdomes. All theÅ¿e you doe vnder colour of religion; as that your practiÅ¿e wrought by moÅ¿t fraudulent wiles, and moÅ¿t wicked attempts doth witneÅ¿Å¿e. This is it by which you wring your Å¿elues into high places; you flatter the eares of the chiefeÅ¿t men; being moÅ¿t skilfull in that matter: And Å¿o you couer your indirect going and Å¿itting amongÅ¿t theÅ¿e Peeres with the mantle of religion and piety (with a miÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe.) We alÅ¿o vnderÅ¿tand (Ã´ fathers vnleÅ¿Å¿e you haue Å¿ome other religion then the Catholike) that you alÅ¿o, after your manner doe attempt the Å¿ame: iuÅ¿t after the manner of SorcereÅ¿Å¿es; which while they can doe no harme to others, doe hurt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elues.</p>
            <p>AmongÅ¿t theÅ¿e excellent EÅ¿tates of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, you bring in alÅ¿o an innouation: where thoÅ¿e Å¿ame good Catholiques are AtheiÅ¿ts, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, and Å¿imple men, they are commonly called: yee doe all for this end, that treacheries and braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings might be brought in, whereby you might fiÅ¿h
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:22038:7"/> in Å¿afety for your company. And truly, not the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> and <hi>Hungarians</hi> onely, but euen your Catholikes, from elÅ¿ewhere doe obiect the fame things vnto you. Where we certainly Å¿uppoÅ¿e this to be in the better part of you; grant vs Ã´ Lord to Å¿peake forth peace in our times: All the turmoiles which you cauÅ¿e (your accuÅ¿ers alleadge) are made for religions Å¿ake (vnder this colour you affect your monarchy amongÅ¿t the Catholikes;) yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withÅ¿tanding they muÅ¿t not be Å¿aid to be vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the profeÅ¿Å¿ors of the GoÅ¿pell at any time, for the cauÅ¿e of religion: O miÅ¿ery; we Å¿uffer not our ciÅ¿terns to be drawne for all, whom we vnderÅ¿tand you runne into.</p>
            <p>For to what end is that plenty? But aboue all we Å¿et before vs the preÅ¿ent eÅ¿tate onely of the <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians.</hi> The Å¿educers of the common people, Å¿ay, that here is no talking of religion: Ã´ blindneÅ¿Å¿e! Let them beleeue that will; they Å¿hall finde to their owne coÅ¿t, that religion is our beginning, middeÅ¿t, and end: by which all things done, or to be done, are ruled; or rather in which they are all contained, your following, Å¿euere, and harÅ¿h proceedings with <hi>CloÅ¿targrab</hi> and <hi>Braunaro</hi> Å¿hall afford you one liuely example of Å¿ixe hundred.</p>
            <p>Hereupon the Emperour <hi>Matthias</hi> wrote very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciÅ¿ely in his late letters to the Earle of <hi>Bucquoy;</hi> Thou Å¿halt deÅ¿erue excellently well of vs, of out Princely houÅ¿e, of religion, and of the Common-weale; if thou wouldeÅ¿t admit of this religion,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:22038:7" rendition="simple:additions"/> Ã´ <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and wouldeÅ¿t entertaine friendÅ¿hip with the <hi>IeÅ¿uites,</hi> thou couldeÅ¿t not haue warre: The <hi>Pope</hi> would bleÅ¿Å¿e thee; the <hi>Spaniard</hi> would Å¿alute thee, and all the whole Clergy would viÅ¿ite thee. But all theÅ¿e things Ã´ Fathers, are vaine; vnleÅ¿Å¿e more weighty matters be behind. For yee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime and condemne all for Heretiks, which doe not obey the <hi>Romane</hi> Church, and yee teach open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that no credit is to be giuen to them. In the meane time yee Å¿tirre vp the Peeres of this Realme one againÅ¿t another by your diuers waies and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiÅ¿es: yee Å¿ow diÅ¿cord betweene the magiÅ¿trates and the Å¿ubiects; and by your vnÅ¿peakeable Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty yee cauÅ¿e variances in this Empire. By which your deceiptfull Å¿tratagem yee haue Å¿hewed your companions to be moÅ¿t deceiptfull; that your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿es are eÅ¿teemed as rotten nuts; yea a ruÅ¿ticke honeÅ¿ty is better than this your learned malice.</p>
            <p>You promiÅ¿e all things vpon oath, but in the end you keepe none. And good reaÅ¿on: for what religion doth bind them to the law, whom their owne religion and the <hi>Popes</hi> Bull doe free from all bonds of Law? You make a politike mixture of thoÅ¿e things which belong to the honour of God and his word, by Å¿aying; As though conÅ¿cience were not Å¿o much to bee kept in politicke matters. Doe not we know theÅ¿e things (good men) we do altogether thinke with him, That there is no greater deceipt in all iniuÅ¿tice then is in them, who then, when they moÅ¿t deceiue,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:22038:8"/> doe it, that they may Å¿eeme to be good men. And truly, they Å¿eeme moÅ¿t Å¿trange to vs enquiring, why faith amongÅ¿t the IeÅ¿uits Å¿hould want followers: Afterward it was told vs that it was prouided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongÅ¿t you long agoe by a Å¿peciall edict, that any man may prouide for other good men by his laÅ¿t will; that faith cannot be Å¿aid hereditary. All the true profeÅ¿Å¿ours of the GoÅ¿pell in the Sacred <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> Empire Å¿hall for euer endanger their liues and Å¿afety vnleÅ¿Å¿e they be carefull, prouident, and watchfull in theÅ¿e and Å¿uch like matters. Good God, was it poÅ¿Å¿ible that theÅ¿e things Å¿hould come to our cares?</p>
            <p>Beleeue it (Ã´ Fathers) euen your inÅ¿truments and meanes by which you doe theÅ¿e things; much more your wicked deeds themÅ¿elues are knowne to vs.</p>
            <p>You haue Sermons; this is a great matter; which like a canker Å¿pread abroad: by which alÅ¿o you ayme at the end of the Oratour, which is, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿wade, and draw others into his owne opinion. To theÅ¿e are added your actions and moÅ¿t Å¿trange va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations in your behauiours and carriages, by which you allure the wayward common people; which do become the Å¿eller of victuals a iuggler or baud, beter then they become a Pulpet. As the Trecen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ian iudgement in <hi>France</hi> is of Father <hi>Binet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither haue you Sermons onely (Ã´ Fathers) but confeÅ¿Å¿ions alÅ¿o, this is greater: by theÅ¿e the condition of euery priuate houÅ¿e, and of the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:22038:8" rendition="simple:additions"/> goodmen of the houÅ¿es, the Å¿ecrets of the whole common-wealth or Kingdome, where you liue; yea the Å¿ecrets of the Romane Empire and their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours are knowne to you. By theÅ¿e (we Å¿ay againe) you deÅ¿eruedly domineere ouer the conÅ¿ciences of men, and by compelling whom you will to vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full things, you moderate all things by your owne reaÅ¿on: becauÅ¿e it is written: VVhoÅ¿e Å¿innes you Å¿hall remit, they are remitted; and whoÅ¿e Å¿innes you retaine, they are retained.</p>
            <p>By this place iniuÅ¿t contracts are made with you, commandements, or wicked and turbulent coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ailes are inioyned with a gentle buzzing, things iniuÅ¿tly gotten are kept Å¿till: loues and vnlawfull mariages are not onely not broken off, but often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are contracted: In a word, the court is kept here.</p>
            <p>To theÅ¿e truely (that I may Å¿peake with you) pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netent men may bee compelled by the prieÅ¿t. For neither was power granted in vaine to the ApoÅ¿tles and their Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ors by ChriÅ¿t, as well to binde as to looÅ¿e.</p>
            <p>LaÅ¿tly, (Ã´ Fathers) this is your chiefeÅ¿t deuice: you haue two Å¿orts of diÅ¿ciples here; all for your owne vÅ¿e and profit: one of them, murtherers of heretique Kings and Peeres, as you call them. whom you neuer ceaÅ¿e to incenÅ¿e and animate with all diligence and care, as alÅ¿o with promiÅ¿es of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting perpetuall glory, and of eÅ¿caping Purgatory. Who can here reÅ¿iÅ¿t Å¿o many armed men?</p>
            <pb n="14" facs="tcp:22038:9"/>
            <p>The other Å¿ort of your diÅ¿ciples are the Å¿onnes of great men, whom while you teach Å¿o, that when the perfection of wit in them Å¿hall come at length to the top and height of knowledge, you Å¿o binde vnto you, together with their parents, that you may haue Å¿ufficient by the helpe of theÅ¿e, wherewithall you may liue, and encreaÅ¿e your companies and religion. You inÅ¿till Logike and Rhetorike into them, that they may be SophiÅ¿ters. This, that they may defend any doubt, perÅ¿wade falÅ¿e things, and open the doores to your companions amongÅ¿t all men. There the truth is ouerwhelmed with deceiptfull diÅ¿tinctions Å¿ophiÅ¿tications, equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocations, and mentall euaÅ¿ions; here it is ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with a trimneÅ¿Å¿e of words, and with a <hi>Ciceronean</hi> eloquence. <hi>And I gaue my heart</hi> (Å¿aith the Preacher) <hi>that I might know WiÅ¿dome and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and my Errours and folly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And not to omit the diuinity, which we heare that you reach, you haue a Å¿ingular methode there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, (as becommeth Å¿ingular men) by which all of your teaching doe expound the Bible philoÅ¿ophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, and PhiloÅ¿ophy like Diuinity; Å¿o that <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿totle</hi> may feed on the flower of their youth, Sathan may rightly challenge to himÅ¿elfe the reÅ¿t thereof.</p>
            <p>O good IeÅ¿u, how theÅ¿e wicked men doe pretend with their AtheiÅ¿me thy moÅ¿t holy name to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿truction of all mankind? But what boldneÅ¿Å¿e and raÅ¿hneÅ¿Å¿e is it of yours (Ã´ Fathers)? wee will not Å¿ay impudency, that you Å¿hould come out of the Pulpit
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:22038:9" rendition="simple:additions"/> (which was beÅ¿towed vpon you in <hi>Bohemia,</hi>) into the Court, and attempt to adminiÅ¿h the weight and worth of his MaieÅ¿ties letters, by a diuerÅ¿e inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, and wreÅ¿ted explication of the words? that you read <hi>Elias Donat, Catoes</hi> DiÅ¿likes, the <hi>Compendium</hi> of Logicke, or the <hi>Epitome</hi> of Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke: when yee diÅ¿puted the Letters not confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Pope; wreÅ¿ted from <hi>Rodolphus,</hi> by the vrging &amp; conÅ¿training of the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> that you taught the Å¿um of PhiÅ¿icks, the extract of Metaphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iks, a breuiary of the whole world; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> you Å¿aid that theÅ¿e letters were not Å¿ubÅ¿cribed of all: Loe wee Å¿weare vnto you, that you had Å¿till remained in your reÅ¿t and quietneÅ¿Å¿e, if omitting theÅ¿e publike, you had conteined your Å¿elues in your owne priuate matters, and in the meane time (being Å¿o buÅ¿ied) had better indoctrinated the children: So it falleth out as often as any tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿eth the limits of his profeÅ¿Å¿ion, and Å¿o, I know not by what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tiny he is iuÅ¿tly puniÅ¿hed for his curioÅ¿ity: <hi>Nature hath giuen to all men to be happy, if any knew how to vÅ¿e it.</hi> VVho alÅ¿o had this Å¿aying, <hi>Let euery one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine within his owne fortune.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreouer, O Fathers, you haue drawne to you wonderfull goods: and that you might be Å¿till dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more wealthy, you were come to that height, that leauing your prieÅ¿tly function, you were not aÅ¿hamed to intrude your Å¿elues into the Å¿ecular go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment. Hereupon you are proclaimed the Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerters of the common good, the enemies and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿troyers
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:22038:10"/> of the kingdome, which cuÅ¿tome of yours Å¿eemes very feeble. For the Kings of the gentiles beare rule: and they which haue power ouer them are liberall: But you not Å¿o, it is your part not to reigne, but to vÅ¿e the rod, and to Å¿hake the feruloe within the territories of your kingdome. This we thinke belongeth to you (Ã´ Fathers) that wee may Å¿peake truely. It is one thing to weaken, another thing to entreat, this belongeth to you. It is one thing to obey, another thing to command; that belongeth to you. It is fitting to keepe prieÅ¿ts in the Å¿tate of humility and obeyÅ¿ance. We (Ã´ good Fathers) but that you goe in an outward Å¿hew and title of holineÅ¿Å¿e, which hath a Å¿hadow of vertue; would by theÅ¿e relations call your vile company, wicked, adulterate, to whom it is pleaÅ¿ant to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue: they had rather haue a great name, then a good name: while they cannot be knowne by their vertues, they deÅ¿ire to be knowne by their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿es. The end of your actions doth declare that, which is, to bring in Å¿ubiection not onely theÅ¿e two Kingdomes, but the whole <hi>Romane</hi> Empire; yea all the whole world to the <hi>SpaniÅ¿h</hi> and <hi>RomiÅ¿h</hi> bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</p>

               <hi>Pliny</hi> (I beleeue) foreknewe this your religiouÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e; Å¿aying, Many doe feare an ill report, fewe an ill conÅ¿ience. But you deale warily, in that you are not aÅ¿hamed to teach openly, that you are Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to no gouernment in the world but to the Sea of Rome. Who therefore Å¿hall iudge you in theÅ¿e coaÅ¿ts? Shall the Pope? VnleÅ¿Å¿e the <hi>Bohemians</hi> and <hi>Hungarians</hi> by chance doe come betweene: You teach the youth for nothing; but for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? This appeares by your Religious houÅ¿es; by the moÅ¿t Princely and Å¿tately Theaters in them: on which you haue Comedies acted, ful of a poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal or HeatheniÅ¿h delights; How faith is not to be kept with Heretikes; How Euangelicall faith is to be rooted out with <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Caluin,</hi> and Å¿uch like things, that you may bee the better emboldned, you Å¿pend whole daies with your Scholers in theÅ¿e delights &amp; pleaÅ¿ures; and the nights alÅ¿o doe you paÅ¿Å¿e ouer on this wiÅ¿e: you are become Å¿o brazen faced through theÅ¿e your doings, that Å¿hortly you may learne to bee quite Å¿hameleÅ¿Å¿e. Hence it is no maruell that you are Winebibbers, Effeminate, Å¿tately, and full of money. Your Schollers bring you Gold as much as they can; that they may neuer ouerloade you. Is vertue to begotten after money? Wee let paÅ¿Å¿e to Å¿peake of your companions in certaine well ordered Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; that one example of Father <hi>Swares</hi> Å¿hall Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice you, which we commit to your moyÅ¿t memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in theÅ¿e things. But who are they whom you
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:22038:13"/> teach for nothing? Are they poore? truely no; they are Heires of great riches and large PoÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ions. TheÅ¿e will not Å¿uffer your Society to want for riches. We wonder that you know not theÅ¿e things. You know many things, and doe you not know your Å¿elues? The Å¿umme of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loÅ¿ophy bids; Know thy Å¿elfe. So no man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth how much he knoweth not. You read <hi>Danus</hi> in <hi>Terence,</hi> but you doe not Å¿ee how you diÅ¿turbe and confound all things. You reade of the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants in <hi>Virgill;</hi> but how you your Å¿elues doe wage Warre with heauen and all the gods, you doe not know. You reade of the <hi>Cyclops</hi> in <hi>Euripides;</hi> but you Å¿ee not how you feare neither God nor man. Truely it is more then Cymmerian darkneÅ¿Å¿e you are in; vnleÅ¿Å¿e you happily imitate <hi>Socrates,</hi> who knew onely this, that he knew nothing. But why doe wee proÅ¿equte theÅ¿e things with Å¿tile and words? One thing we adde of thoÅ¿e huge ones, before we bring in the ConcluÅ¿ion. You IeÅ¿uits were meere AeoluÅ¿es, who Å¿ent your boyÅ¿terous Northerne and EaÅ¿terne windes vpon this age, and the whole Romane Empire: that you might onely obtaine the moÅ¿t curÅ¿ed ende of your Sect; namely, the Monarchie of the whole world, and Å¿ubiect all the Kingdomes of the World to the Sea of Rome. Hence doe troubles compaÅ¿Å¿e vs about like vnto <hi>Numida,</hi> and new waues amongÅ¿t the Å¿urges. O when Å¿hall wee be in that pure and certaine calme, which you haue couered with
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:22038:13" rendition="simple:additions"/> clowdes, that Å¿hortly will cauÅ¿e a tempeÅ¿t. The aÅ¿hes which you Å¿pread abroad Å¿eeme to returne to you, ready to burne vp your Society. The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture Å¿aith, <hi>In the multiplying of the wicked, wickedneÅ¿Å¿e Å¿hall be multiplyed, and the iuÅ¿t Å¿hall Å¿ee their falles.</hi> But that wee may make an ende of theÅ¿e things which we Å¿ay by the report of others, do not thinke (O Fathers IeÅ¿uits) that wee would hurt any of your Society hereby; for they are not ours: but Å¿uch as long Å¿ince were obiected againÅ¿t you by the whole world: which things, becauÅ¿e you haue not anÅ¿wered; I thought good to mooue, not for vpbrayding, but for conference Å¿ake.</p>
            <p>It is not poÅ¿Å¿ible (me thinke) that Religion and Å¿o many wickedneÅ¿Å¿es Å¿hould dwell together in one Colledge: which if you Å¿hould Å¿uffer to reÅ¿ide vpon you, Å¿urely we would Å¿ay that you are the worÅ¿t of all that goe on two feete: whoÅ¿e bodies are hardened with Å¿o many skarres of villany and wickedneÅ¿Å¿es, that there is no roome for another Å¿troke. But, though we knowe no other by you, yet we hope better. For whither you goe; you immitate the NouenÅ¿ilian gods. Doe you make Å¿peeches? your lippes are beÅ¿meered with <hi>Cicero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> eloquence. Doe you laugh? the Graces Å¿eem to be in your eyes. Doe you pray?

O yee Lords &amp; Princes of the Empire, if all the <hi>Spaniards</hi> heare me, let them view with a curious eye the Lands Å¿ituated with long diÅ¿tance of place, to which they deny paÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿age; they cut off ayde, and doe waÅ¿te all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: this is a hard matter, but he will put to his hand againe that the <hi>Spaniard</hi> may bring forth the extreameÅ¿t of his cruelty and tyrranny, that the Subiects lamentably Å¿hould Å¿ee the laÅ¿t Act of the Tragedy: whoÅ¿e heart doth ake through the feare and horror of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> that they can deÅ¿ire nothing but occaÅ¿ion how they may gett out of this bondage into their former liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
